Description: Dummy PulseAudio package that installs plain nothing.
	Many people don't actually like pulseaudio, to the point they don't
	want any of that garbage installed on their systems. They can now
	easily pin this package from some of their repositories to remove the
	automatic dependency pulling of pulseaudio package forever. This breaks
	packages that really need pulseaudio.
